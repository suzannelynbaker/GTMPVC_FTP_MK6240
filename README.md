# GTMPVC_FTP_MK6240

This code GTM PVC code is based on the code for our Neuroimage Data In Brief PVC code developed for AV1451.  The primary difference is this code uses a watershed technique to define extra-cortical hotspots (ECHs).  It searches the extra-cortical area (c3+c4+c5 defined by SPM12) and finds the voxel with the highest value.  It says that is ECH1.  It then decreases the value slightly and searches for voxels at or above the new search value.  If the voxel is next to a voxel from ECH1, it joins ECH1.  If not, it becomes ECH2.  This continues until the minimum search value is reached.  

This code was developed using a MK6240 and FTP head-to-head dataset acquired at University of Pittsburgh on 15 subjects.  This version of ROIs used for GTM PVC resulted in the best fit of the original data in comparison to other ROI options (including using a meninges mask and not defining ECHs).  The extra-cortical space is defined differently within subject for different tracers given the meningeal signal in MK6240 and the discrete hotspots found in FTP.  We are submitting a paper to Neuroimage using this code.  If you end up using it and publishing results, please cite our paper.
